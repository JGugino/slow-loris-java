This is a small slow loris application created in Java, please not that this program has not been optimized
and has the possibly of crashes. This was created more as a proof of concept to see if I could actually create
a proper slow loris program.

Although it does work at flooding a HTTP server with tons of requests, and eventually slowing it down enough that more
requests can't come through. It does this more by just spamming requests instead of leaving a connection open and slowly
sending requests.

#### *Again I can not stress this enough, this program is to be used for educational purposes only and to only be used against Http servers you have premission to do this form of attack on. I am not liable for any damages or charges that come from the use of this program.*

Once you compile the project into a runnable .jar file, you can start it through
a .bat file with the following command to get console output on what the program is doing.

```batch
java -jar <jar-name>.jar
```
